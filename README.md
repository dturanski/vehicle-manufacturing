#Vehicle Manufacturing Process

Prototype of manufacturing process

## Assumptions

Fully automated process - no human interaction involved in any of the steps.

The process is not linear - once the body is built, add engine, add transmission, add trim can happen in parallel, in any order.

The QA step cannot be completed until the assembly is complete.
